Distributed Cache System using Spring Boot, JOOQ, and Consistent Hashing This project implements a distributed LRU cache with consistent hashing, supporting thread-safe in-memory caching and database persistence using PostgreSQL &amp; JOOQ. The cache follows the cache-aside pattern and dynamically distributes keys across cache nodes.
